Your dedication to breaking barriers in arts education through instrument rentals, repair services, digital curriculums, and community concerts is truly commendable.<br>

By ensuring that children in marginalized communities have access to the transformative power of music, you are not only fostering creativity but also strengthening our communities. The work you do aligns with my commitment to expanding opportunities for young people and supporting arts education in our city.<br>

It has been a pleasure sponsoring <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> musical events in my district to entertain and inform my constituents of its mission. I look forward to seeing <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> continue to grow and positively impact even more students.<br>

Please do not hesitate to reach out if my office can be of further assistance."`,

Earlier this year, <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> provided critical funding that enabled ETM to repair twelve school-owned band instruments at PS 154 in Queensâ€”an ETM partner school serving a predominantly low-income, Title I student population.<br>

These repairs supported our joint goal of expanding the school's band program from 35 to 50 students, creating more opportunities for children to engage with music.<br>

We share in <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong>'s mission to ensure no child is excluded from the joy and growth of music because of financial hardship, which aligns with ETM's own commitment to educational equity.<br>

ETM looks forward to continuing our partnership with <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> and working together again in the future to ensure that every child has access to the power of music."`,

Their mission to bridge the gap in musical education resonates deeply with our values of education, preservation, and community engagement.<br>

<strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> has already left a profound impact on our own community, having brought their extraordinary talents to Maple Grove Cemetery in a concert that not only showcased their musicianship but also uplifted and inspired all who attended.<br>

Through free instrument rentals, curriculum support for teachers, and partnerships with underfunded schools, <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> fosters an environment where young musicians can flourish.<br>

We wholeheartedly endorse <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> and encourage any institution or funding body to invest in their invaluable work.<br>

Their impact is not only measurable. It is transformative."`,

            `"As the music teacher at PS 153 in Maspeth, Queens, New York, my dream is to have a band program that inspires students to become life-long learners of music.<br>
We have over 110 instruments that have been in a state of disrepair for over ten years. I have inventoried and set aside specific instruments for the program: 10 flutes, 12 clarinets, 8 saxophones, 10 trumpets, 10 trombones, and 5 euphoniums.<br>

Our current band has 30 students who are eager to play. However, their instruments frequently fall apart or make it difficult to produce a good sound, hindering their progress.<br>

I often spend 10 or more minutes per class diagnosing and fixing instrument issues, which reduces valuable playing time. Students currently get only 20 minutes of playing time per week, but with working instruments, they could get 30-40 minutes.<br>

As a Title 1 school, we have limited funds for instrument replacement or repair within the music budget.<br>

We are asking <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> to help us find someone to properly repair these instruments. The instruments are of good quality and, if repaired and maintained, could last for 2 or 3 years, benefiting both current and future students.<br>

This would save the school money, engage students, reduce obstacles to success, and foster student accomplishment and joy with functional instruments.<br>

The many instruments are in a sorry state, and <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> fixing them would have a significant, long-term impact on students at our Title 1 school.<br>

As the sole source of music education in the area, quality instruments would enable students to achieve success. We want to plant the seeds for future musicians that can grow into life-long learners of music."`,
