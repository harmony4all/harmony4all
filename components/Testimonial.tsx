Your dedication to breaking barriers in arts education through instrument rentals, repair services, digital curriculums, and community concerts is truly commendable.<br>

By ensuring that children in marginalized communities have access to the transformative power of music, you are not only fostering creativity but also strengthening our communities. The work you do aligns with my commitment to expanding opportunities for young people and supporting arts education in our city.<br>

It has been a pleasure sponsoring <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> musical events in my district to entertain and inform my constituents of its mission. I look forward to seeing <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> continue to grow and positively impact even more students.<br>

Please do not hesitate to reach out if my office can be of further assistance."`,

Earlier this year, <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> provided critical funding that enabled ETM to repair twelve school-owned band instruments at PS 154 in Queensâ€”an ETM partner school serving a predominantly low-income, Title I student population.<br>

These repairs supported our joint goal of expanding the school's band program from 35 to 50 students, creating more opportunities for children to engage with music.<br>

We share in <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong>'s mission to ensure no child is excluded from the joy and growth of music because of financial hardship, which aligns with ETM's own commitment to educational equity.<br>

ETM looks forward to continuing our partnership with <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> and working together again in the future to ensure that every child has access to the power of music."`,

ETM has also helped us launch and sustain our 4th & 5th grade band program. This has been a wonderful opportunity for many of our students and we would like to continue to provide this opportunity to even more students moving forward.<br>

However, the cost of purchasing new band instruments at this time is not possible. So, by providing the funds to repair these 12 school-owned instruments at P.S. 154 Queens, you will allow many more students to participate in the school band program for many years to come, further enriching their music education.<br>

I sincerely hope you can partner with ETM to make this possible."`,

Their mission to bridge the gap in musical education resonates deeply with our values of education, preservation, and community engagement.<br>

<strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> has already left a profound impact on our own community, having brought their extraordinary talents to Maple Grove Cemetery in a concert that not only showcased their musicianship but also uplifted and inspired all who attended.<br>

Through free instrument rentals, curriculum support for teachers, and partnerships with underfunded schools, <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> fosters an environment where young musicians can flourish.<br>

We wholeheartedly endorse <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> and encourage any institution or funding body to invest in their invaluable work.<br>

Their impact is not only measurable. It is transformative."`,
