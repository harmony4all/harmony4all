<strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has been instrumental in creating meaningful musical opportunities for students who would otherwise lack access to music education, instrument rentals, and essential repairs.<br>

In 2024, my office had the privilege of partnering with <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> to bring music to our community through engaging performances and initiatives that uplifted constituents of all ages. This partnership exemplifies our shared commitment to equity in music education, ensuring that every child, regardless of their socioeconomic background, has access to enriching learning experiences.<br>

I fully support <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong>'s efforts to expand its programming and impact, as they not only provide free access to music education but also strengthen communities by fostering creativity, cultural engagement, and youth empowerment. With additional financial support, <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> can reach even more students, ensuring that music remains a vital and accessible part of education in our city.<br>

Earlier this year, <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> provided critical funding that enabled ETM to repair twelve school-owned band instruments at PS 154 in Queens—an ETM partner school serving a predominantly low-income, Title I student population.<br>

These repairs supported our joint goal of expanding the school's band program from 35 to 50 students, creating more opportunities for children to engage with music, giving students at PS 154 access to functional, high-quality instruments for years to come.<br>

We share in <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong>'s mission to ensure no child is excluded from the joy and growth of music because of financial hardship, which aligns with ETM's own commitment to educational equity.<br>

ETM looks forward to continuing our partnership with <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> and working together again in the future to ensure that every child has access to the power of music."`,

        `"On behalf of the Friends of Maple Grove Cemetery, it is with great enthusiasm that I offer this letter of support for <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong>, a remarkable nonprofit dedicated to making music education accessible to underserved students in New York City. Their mission to bridge the gap in musical education resonates deeply with our values of education, preservation, and community engagement.<br>

<strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> has already left a profound impact on our own community, having brought their extraordinary talents to Maple Grove Cemetery in a concert that not only showcased their musicianship but also uplifted and inspired all who attended. Their commitment to ensuring that students, regardless of financial barriers, have access to quality instruments, instruction, and opportunities is nothing short of commendable.<br>

Through free instrument rentals, curriculum support for teachers, and partnerships with underfunded schools, <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> fosters an environment where young musicians can flourish. The dedication of co-founders <strong>Bianca</strong> and <strong>Joshua Quddus</strong>, both extraordinary young leaders and musicians, reflects the organization's passion for not only music but also equity and empowerment. Their efforts extend beyond performance—they are shaping the future of arts education, ensuring that the universal language of music is accessible to all.<br>

At Maple Grove, we understand the power of music to transcend generations and bring people together. The work of <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> aligns with this philosophy, creating meaningful experiences that enrich the lives of young artists and the communities they touch. It is our sincere hope that this outstanding organization receives the funding and support necessary to continue its mission and expand its reach.<br>

We wholeheartedly endorse <strong>Harmony 4 All</strong> and encourage any institution or funding body to invest in their invaluable work. Their impact is not only measurable. It is transformative."`,
